  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: 'You are working on a App called "starfires_v2" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks
    that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you''re working on, you''re given other specs for "starfires_v2"
    as well.


    Here is a high level description of "starfires_v2":

    ```

    The project, "starfires_v2," is an Astrology website offering live event participation with video streaming, a digital
    storefront for astrology books, an informative single-admin blog, and mastery courses featuring user progress tracking
    and assessments. The development stack includes React, Node.js, Express, Python for astrological computations, Socket.IO
    for real-time communication, MongoDB, and authentication with OAuth or JWT. The site will provide features like natal
    chart calculations, transit forecasts, synastry and compatibility reports, progression charts, electional astrology, horary
    astrology, and event matching based on astrological data. The process encompasses UI/UX design, functionality and user
    experience testing, deployment to a cloud hosting service, and ongoing maintenance for content updates and security.

    ```



    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - React


    - Node.js


    - Express


    - Python


    - Swagger


    - Socket.IO


    - MongoDB


    - Mongoose


    - OAuth


    - JWT


    - Bootstrap


    - HTML


    - CSS3


    - D3.js


    - axios


    - cronjob


    ```






    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Initialize the Node.js backend, setup Express server with basic routing, and install core dependencies.


    2. Configure MongoDB database connection using Mongoose and create a User schema to handle user data.


    3. Implement authentication system using OAuth and JWT with routes for registration, login, and user session management.


    4. Build the React frontend setup along with the initial UI components using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3.


    5. Integrate Socket.IO for real-time communication and setup mechanisms to handle live video streaming on the platform.


    6. Design and implement the digital storefront including the schema for store products and the shopping cart functionality.


    7. Create the blog infrastructure with single-admin CRUD operations and draft blogging interface.


    8. Develop mastery courses area with user progress tracking, assessments and Python backend computation for astrology
    charts.


    9. Implement natal chart calculations, transit forecasts, compatibility reports, and other astrological services.


    10. Setup D3.js integration for data visualization and implement dynamic charts representing astrological data.


    11. Refine UI/UX and ensure responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and implement graceful error handling.


    12. Create a cron job for routine database backup and maintenance.


    13. Conduct final integration testing to ensure all components of the website operate cohesively.


    ```


    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Initialize the Node.js backend, setup Express server with basic routing, and install core dependencies.

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Reviewer can send a GET request
    to ''/api/ping'' endpoint and receive the expected JSON response.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'

  content: "To implement task #1, you need to initialize the Node.js environment, set up Express with basic routing, and install\
    \ the necessary core dependencies. Here is what needs to be done:\n\n### Step 1: Initialize Node.js Project\nRun the following\
    \ command in the terminal to initialize the project and create a `package.json` file:\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n### Step\
    \ 2: Install Core Dependencies\nInstall Express and other essential dependencies using npm. Run these commands:\n```\n\
    npm install express\nnpm install nodemon --save-dev\n```\n\n`nodemon` is used to automatically restart the server on code\
    \ changes.\n\n### Step 3: Set up Express Server and Basic Routing\nNow, we will set up the Express server with a basic\
    \ routing to respond to a GET request on `/api/ping`.\n\nCreate and configure the `server.js` file:\n```\n./server.js\n\
    ```\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\n\n// Create an instance of express\nconst app = express();\n\n\
    // Define a port to avoid using the reserved one (5000)\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// Basic route to respond\
    \ to '/api/ping' with a JSON message\napp.get('/api/ping', (req, res) => {\n    res.json({ message: 'pong' });\n});\n\n\
    // Start server\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Step\
    \ 4: Configure Nodemon for Development\nSet up nodemon to watch for changes in the project and restart the server automatically.\
    \ \n\nCreate a `nodemon.json` file for configuration:\n```\n./nodemon.json\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"watch\": [\"*.js\"],\n\
    \  \"ignore\": [\"node_modules\"],\n  \"exec\": \"node ./server.js\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"NODE_ENV\": \"development\"\
    \n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Add Start Script to package.json\nIn the `package.json` file, add the start script to run\
    \ the server with nodemon.\n\nUpdate the `package.json` file:\n```\n./package.json\n```\nAdd this inside the `scripts`\
    \ object:\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"nodemon\"\n},\n```\n\n### Running the Server\nNow that all the code\
    \ and configuration have been set, you can start the server by running the following command:\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\n\
    The server will start, and it will listen on the selected port other than 5000, as per the requirements. To test if the\
    \ server is running correctly, you can use a tool like `curl`, a browser or an API client like Postman to send a GET request\
    \ to `http://localhost:[PORT]/api/ping`. You should receive a JSON response:\n```json\n{ \"message\": \"pong\" }\n```\n\
    \nThis completes the implementation of task #1. The server is now properly set up with Express, and it's responding to\
    \ a specific API endpoint as expected, fulfilling the programmatic goal for the task.\n\nThe human developer reviewing\
    \ the task will be looking to confirm that when they send a GET request to the `/api/ping` endpoint, they receive the\
    \ expected JSON response, satisfying the user-review goal."

    run. When you need to change code, make sure that you put the entire content of the file in the value of `content` key
    even though you will likely copy and paste the most of the previous message. The commands must be able to run on a Darwin
    machine.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Within the file modifications, anything needs to be written by the user, add the comment in the same line as the code
    that starts with `// INPUT_REQUIRED {input_description}` where `input_description` is a description of what needs to be
    added here by the user. Just make sure that you put comments only inside files that support comments (e.g. not in JSON
    files).


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you want to add a comment that tells the user to add the previous implementation at that place, make sure that the
    comment starts with `[OLD CODE]` and add a description of what old code should be inserted here. For example, `[OLD CODE]
    Login route`.
