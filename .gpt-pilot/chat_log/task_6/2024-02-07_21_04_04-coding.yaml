  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `starfires_v2_frontend/src/App.js` looks like right now:\n```\nimport React from 'react';\n\
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport NavigationBar from './components/NavigationBar';\n\
    import Footer from './components/Footer';\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\nimport Stargate from './pages/Stargate';\
    \ // Ensure you have these components created\nimport Library from './pages/Library';\nimport Treasures from './pages/Treasures';\n\
    import Mastery from './pages/Mastery';\nimport Consultations from './pages/Consultations';\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction\
    \ App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <NavigationBar />\n        <Routes>\n    \
    \      <Route path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\n          <Route path=\"/stargate\" element={<Stargate />} />\n      \

    \  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the new implementation for the same file:\n```\nimport React from\
    \ 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport NavigationBar from './components/NavigationBar';\n\
    import Footer from './components/Footer';\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\n// [OLD CODE] Import all previously imported\
    \ pages here\nimport CartPage from './pages/CartPage';  // Import the new CartPage component\n\nfunction App() {\n  return\
    \ (\n    <Router>\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <NavigationBar />\n        <Routes>\n          {/* [OLD CODE]\
    \ Define additional routes here */}\n          <Route path=\"/cart\" element={<CartPage />} />  {/* Add this new route\
    \ */}\n        </Routes>\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n```\n\nNow,\
    \ implement the new changes into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines\
    \ of code that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    All lines of code in the new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are\
    \ replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all\
    \ lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant\
    \ logic that was in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten.\
    \ Every single line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include\
    \ any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."
