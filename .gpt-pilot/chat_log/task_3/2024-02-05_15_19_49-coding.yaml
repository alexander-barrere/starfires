  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"starfires_v2\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    starfires_v2\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"starfires_v2\":\n```\nThe project, \"starfires_v2,\"\
    \ is an Astrology website offering live event participation with video streaming, a digital storefront for astrology books,\
    \ an informative single-admin blog, and mastery courses featuring user progress tracking and assessments. The development\
    \ stack includes React, Node.js, Express, Python for astrological computations, Socket.IO for real-time communication,\
    \ MongoDB, and authentication with OAuth or JWT. The site will provide features like natal chart calculations, transit\
    \ forecasts, synastry and compatibility reports, progression charts, electional astrology, horary astrology, and event\
    \ matching based on astrological data. The process encompasses UI/UX design, functionality and user experience testing,\
    \ deployment to a cloud hosting service, and ongoing maintenance for content updates and security.\n```\n\n\nHere are\
    \ the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- React\n\n- Node.js\n\n- Express\n\n- Python\n\n- Swagger\n\

    \ for registration, login, and user session management.\n\n4. Build the React frontend setup along with the initial UI\
    \ components using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3.\n\n5. Integrate Socket.IO for real-time communication and setup mechanisms\
    \ to handle live video streaming on the platform.\n\n6. Design and implement the digital storefront including the schema\
    \ for store products and the shopping cart functionality.\n\n7. Create the blog infrastructure with single-admin CRUD\
    \ operations and draft blogging interface.\n\n8. Develop mastery courses area with user progress tracking, assessments\
    \ and Python backend computation for astrology charts.\n\n9. Implement natal chart calculations, transit forecasts, compatibility\
    \ reports, and other astrological services.\n\n10. Setup D3.js integration for data visualization and implement dynamic\
    \ charts representing astrological data.\n\n11. Refine UI/UX and ensure responsive design, cross-browser compatibility,\
    \ and implement graceful error handling.\n\n12. Create a cron job for routine database backup and maintenance.\n\n13.\
    \ Conduct final integration testing to ensure all components of the website operate cohesively.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently\
    \ working on task #3 with the following description:\n```\nImplement authentication system using OAuth and JWT with routes\
    \ for registration, login, and user session management.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work\
    \ on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `User can register\
    \ an account and, upon registration, can log in and receive a token that grants access to authenticated routes.`\n\nNow,\
    \ tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands\
    \ that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code\
    \ go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.\
    \ Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember,\
    \ I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do\
    \ not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created\
    \ automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to\
    \ run the app, it's reserved."

  content: "To implement an authentication system using OAuth and JWT with routes for registration, login, and user session\
    \ management, we need to install additional dependencies, create new routes, implement controller logic, define JWT strategies,\
    \ and integrate OAuth providers if necessary. Only code snippets relevant to Task #3 will be provided. Please note that\
    \ the OAuth implementation is usually more complex due to the need to register the app with the OAuth provider (like Google\
    \ or Facebook) to get the client ID and secret, which are not covered here.\n\n**Step 1: Install Dependencies**\n\nRun\
    \ the following command to install the necessary packages:\n```\nnpm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken passport passport-jwt\
    \ Information (if applicable)**\n\n```js\n// models/User.js\nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  // existing fields...\n\
    \  googleId: {\n    type: String,\n    default: null\n  },\n  // ...other OAuth provider fields if required.\n});\n```\n\
    \n**Step 3: Implement the Authentication Strategy**\n\n**Create an Auth Helper for JWT**\n\n```js\n// config/auth.js\n\
    const User = require('../models/User');\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv');\n\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst options = {\n\
    \  jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),\n  secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_SECRET\n};\n\nconst jwtStrategy\
    \ = new JwtStrategy(options, async (jwt_payload, done) => {\n  try {\n    // Find the user specified in token\n    const\
    \ user = await User.findById(jwt_payload.sub);\n  \n    // If the user doesn't exist, handle it\n    if (!user) {\n  \
    \    return done(null, false);\n    }\n    \n    // Otherwise, return the user\n    done(null, user);\n  } catch (error)\
    \ {\n    done(error, false);\n  }\n});\n\n// Strategy for Google OAuth; substitute values for CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET\

    \n// Initialize Passport middleware\napp.use(passport.initialize());\n```\n\n**Step 5: Implement Registration and Login\
    \ Routes**\n\n**Routes File**\n```js\n// routes/auth.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { check, validationResult\
    \ } = require('express-validator');\nconst UserController = require('../controllers/userController');\nconst router =\

    \ }] });\n    }\n\n    user = new User({\n      username,\n      email,\n      password\n    });\n\n    const salt = await\
    \ bcrypt.genSalt(10);\n    user.password = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);\n\n    await user.save();\n\n    const payload\

    \    }\n    );\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.message);\n    res.status(500).send('Server error');\n  }\n};\n\
    \nexports.login = async (req, res) => {\n  const errors = validationResult(req);\n  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n    return\
    \ res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });\n  }\n\n  const { email, password } = req.body;\n\n  try {\n    let\
    \ user = await User.findOne({ email });\n\n    if (!user) {\n      return res.status(400).json({ errors: [{ msg: 'Invalid\
    \ Credentials' }] });\n    }\n\n    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);\n\n    if (!isMatch)\
    \ {\n      return res.status(400).json({ errors: [{ msg: 'Invalid Credentials' }] });\n    }\n\n    const payload = {\n\
    \      user: {\n        id: user.id\n      }\n    };\n\n    jwt.sign(\n      payload,\n      process.env.JWT_SECRET,\n\
    \      { expiresIn: 360000 },\n      (err, token) => {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        res.json({ token });\n  \
    \    }\n    );\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.message);\n    res.status(500).send('Server error');\n  }\n};\n\
    \n// Export more functions as needed for session management etc.\n\n```\n\n**Step 6: Update the Server to Use New Routes**\n\
    \n```js\n// server.js at the bottom, before app.listen(...)\nconst authRoutes = require('./routes/auth');\n\napp.use('/api/users',\
    \ authRoutes);\n```\n\n**Step 7: Update Environment Variables**\n\nYou will need to add `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,\
    \ and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` to your .env file, with appropriate values that you have configured with your OAuth provider.\n\
    \n**Step 8: Integrate the Authentication Logic with Your Other Routes**\n\nIn routes where authentication is required,\
    \ you will need to import passport and apply the following middleware:\n```js\nconst passport = require('passport');\n\
    // As the second parameter, passport.authenticate(...), on necessary routes where authentication is required.\n```\n\n\
    **IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n- The given code snippets lack OAuth implementation details. They are typically more intricate,\
    \ requiring interaction with the external OAuth provider's API, potential session handling, and upon successful OAuth\
    \ authentication, generating and returning JWT tokens to the client similarly to how it's done in the `exports.login`\
    \ function.\n- For the purpose of brevity and relevance to the task, error handling and response formatting are somewhat\
    \ simplified.\n- The `User` model update assumes a potential future requirement for OAuth integration. If only JWT-based\
    \ authentication is being implemented, the OAuth-related fields can be omitted.\n- All user input should be validated\
    \ and sanitized properly using a library like `express-validator` to prevent common security issues."

  content: 'How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully? If you specify a command that needs to be run
    or give example, be very specific. You don''t want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just
    follow your instructions. Note that any commands will be run on a Darwin machine.


    **IMPORTANT**

    In case the task can be tested by making an API request, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather
    write a full cURL command that the user can just run.

    **IMPORTANT**

    Do not require any code writing form the user for testing this task.


    Try your best to avoid this if possible, but if it is very difficult to test the task, you can just answer with only this
    sentence - `There is nothing specific to test for this task so you can write "continue" and we''ll move on to the next
    task.`'
response: 'To test if the task was completed successfully, a human user can attempt to register a new account and then try
  to login with that account using the provided routes. They will use cURL commands to make HTTP requests to the Node.js server.


  Make sure the Node.js server from the `starfires_v2` application is running by executing the following command:


  ```sh

  npm start

  ```


  Once the server is running, the user can execute the following cURL commands in their terminal:


  1. **Register a new user account:** This command sends a POST request to the server with a new username, email, and password.


  ```sh

  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/users/register \

  -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \

  -d ''{"username": "testuser", "email": "testuser@example.com", "password": "password123"}''

  ```


  Upon successful execution of the above command, the server should respond with a JSON object containing the JWT token.


  2. **Login with registered account:** This command sends a POST request with the user''s login credentials.


  ```sh

  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/users/login \

  -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \

  -d ''{"email": "testuser@example.com", "password": "password123"}''

  ```


  Similarly, the server should respond with a JSON object containing a JWT token if the login is successful. The user should
  ensure they receive a status code of `200 OK` and a token field in the response.


  Note: If the registration or login process fails (e.g., due to validation errors, user already exists, wrong credentials),
  the server should respond with appropriate error messages and status codes. The user can ascertain the success of the task
  by the presence of the token in the successful responses and by checking for any error messages.'
