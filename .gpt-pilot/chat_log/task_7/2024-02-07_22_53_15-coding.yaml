  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `/middleware/updateUserRole.js/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the new\
    \ implementation for the same file:\n```\nconst User = require('../models/User');\n\nconst updateUserRole = async (req,\
    \ res, next) => {\n  try {\n    const user = await User.findById(req.user.id);\n    if (user && !user.isSubscriber) {\n\
    \      user.role = 'subscriber';\n      user.isSubscriber = true; // [OLD CODE] Add isSubscriber field to User model if\
    \ not present\n      await user.save();\n    }\n    next();\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error updating user\
    \ role:', error);\n    res.status(500).send('Server error');\n  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = updateUserRole;\n\n```\n\nNow,\
    \ implement the new changes into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines\
    \ of code that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    All lines of code in the new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are\
    \ replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all\
    \ lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant\
    \ logic that was in the original code.\nUnder no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten.\
    \ Every single line of code that exists in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include\
    \ any code that is above or below the comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."
