  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: 'Here is how the file `routes/userRoutes.js` looks like right now:

    ```

    const express = require(''express'');

    const router = express.Router();

    const userProfileController = require(''../controllers/userProfileController'');

    const passport = require(''passport'');


    // ... Other route declarations


    router.get(''/profile/astrology-chart'', passport.authenticate(''jwt'', { session: false }), userProfileController.getAstrologyChart);


    // ... Other route declarations


    module.exports = router;


    ```


    And here is the new implementation for the same file:

    ```

    const express = require(''express'');

    const router = express.Router();

    const userProfileController = require(''../controllers/userProfileController'');

    const passport = require(''passport'');


    // [OLD CODE] Include other routes for user operations


    router.post(''/profile'', passport.authenticate(''jwt'', { session: false }), userProfileController.updateProfile);


    // [OLD CODE] Add other user routes


    module.exports = router;


    ```


    Now, implement the new changes into the previously implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any
    lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the new implementation but only combine those two.


    **IMPORTANT**

    All lines of code in the new implementation should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are
    replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new implementation


    **IMPORTANT**

    Make sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments, including all control structures,
    error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.

    Under no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists
    in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the
    comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment.'
