  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `/controllers/courseController.js/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the\
    \ new implementation for the same file:\n```\n// All the imports required for the controller\nconst Course = require('../models/Course');\n\
    const UserProgress = require('../models/UserProgress');\nconst Assessment = require('../models/Assessment');\nconst axios\
    \ = require('axios');\nconst astrologyServiceUrl = 'http://localhost:5001/compute';\n\n// Define all the controller functions\
    \ here\n// [OLD CODE] Add previous code for getCourses, getUserProgress, and getAssessmentForCourse functions\n\n// Function\
    \ to get astrology chart computation\nexports.getAstrologyChart = async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { userData\
    \ } = req.body;\n    const result = await axios.post(astrologyServiceUrl, userData);\n    res.json(result.data);\n  }\
    \ catch (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n    res.status(500).send('Server error');\n  }\n};\n\n// [OLD CODE] Insert any\
    \ additional controller logic that was previously implemented\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into the previously\
    \ implemented file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously coded\
    \ file or the new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the new implementation\
    \ should be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in\
    \ the new implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these\
    \ comments, including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.\n\
    Under no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists\
    \ in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the\
    \ comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."
