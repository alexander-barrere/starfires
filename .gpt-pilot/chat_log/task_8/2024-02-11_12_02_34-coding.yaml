  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "Here is how the file `/controllers/purchaseController.js/` looks like right now:\n```\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the\
    \ new implementation for the same file:\n```\nconst User = require('../models/User');\nconst Product = require('../models/Product');\n\
    const Course = require('../models/Course');\n// Assuming there are models for order and transactions etc.\n\nexports.handleProductPurchase\
    \ = async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { userId, productId } = req.body;\n    // [OLD CODE] Implement logic to\
    \ create an order and associate product with user\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Purchase successful.' });\n  }\
    \ catch (error) {\n    res.status(400).json({ message: 'Purchase failed', error: error.message });\n  }\n};\n// Add methods\
    \ for handling course purchases and subscriptions\n\n```\n\nNow, implement the new changes into the previously implemented\
    \ file and return the entirely coded file. Do not add any lines of code that are not in the previously coded file or the\
    \ new implementation but only combine those two.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nAll lines of code in the new implementation should\
    \ be present. From the old implementation, only take the ones that are replaced with the comment `[OLD CODE]` in the new\
    \ implementation\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nMake sure that you respond with all lines of code that are replaced by these comments,\
    \ including all control structures, error handling, and any other relevant logic that was in the original code.\nUnder\
    \ no circumstances should you ever leave any part of the code snippet unwritten. Every single line of code that exists\
    \ in the place where the comment lives right now should be replaced. Do not include any code that is above or below the\
    \ comment but only the code that should be in the position of the comment."
