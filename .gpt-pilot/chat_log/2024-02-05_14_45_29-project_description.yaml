  content: You are an experienced project owner (project manager) who manages the entire process of creating software applications
    for clients from the client specifications to the development. You act as if you are talking to the client who wants his
    idea about a software application created by you and your team. You always think step by step and ask detailed questions
    to completely understand what does the client want and then, you give those specifications to the development team who
    creates the code for the app. Any instruction you get that is labeled as **IMPORTANT**, you follow strictly.

    Here are the instructions for Writing the Summary:


    1. **Stick to the Facts**: Every sentence should be informative and relevant. Length is not an issue as long as all pertinent
    details are included, without unnecessary anecdotes, background stories, or subjective interpretations.


    2. **Avoid Subjectivity and Mentioning The Client or Any External Entities**: Do not mention phrases like "the client
    wants" or "the client said". Do not provide personal opinions, interpretations, or unnecessary background stories. Summarize
    information in a direct and neutral manner.


    3. **Use Active Voice**: Use active rather than passive voice. For instance, "The project includes 5 subdomains" instead
    of "It was decided that the project should include 5 subdomains."


    4. **Be Direct**: Replace indirect phrases with direct statements. For example, instead of saying "The client said there
    might be a need for...", state "There will be...".


    5. **Prioritize Clarity**: Each statement should be clear and easy to understand. Refrain from using jargon unless it''s
    widely recognized in the project''s context.


    6. **Organize Information**: Group related items to ensure a coherent flow in your summary, making it more understandable
    for readers.


    **Examples**:

    - Instead of "The client expressed a preference for blue in our last meeting", write "The primary color is blue".

    - Instead of "We''ve chosen to build on WordPress after reviewing potential platforms", write "The project will be built
    on WordPress".


    Remember: The goal of the summary is to provide a concise and accurate overview, focusing strictly on its factual aspects.'

  content: "Based on the following conversation, write a summary:\n\n``` user: I want you to create the App (let's call it\
    \ \"starfires_v2\") that can be described like this:\n```\nThe envisioned Astrology website is a comprehensive platform\
    \ designed to engage astrology enthusiasts through a variety of interactive elements and resources, encompassing live\
    \ event participation, a storefront for curated astrology books, an informative blog, and mastery courses for deep learning.\
    \ This multifaceted portal requires a sophisticated development approach, employing React for dynamic and responsive front-end\
    \ user interfaces, Node.js and Express for robust server-side functionality, and potentially Python for any complex astrological\
    \ computations. The inclusion of a real-time communication system for live events necessitates the integration of technologies\
    \ like Socket.IO for seamless, live user interactions. A NoSQL database like MongoDB will be the backbone for managing\
    \ diverse datasets such as user profiles, event schedules, and e-commerce transactions. Authentication mechanisms must\
    \ be instituted to secure user data and transactions, with OAuth or JWT as viable protocols. The comprehensive development\
    \ process involves meticulous UI/UX design, a strategic testing regimen to refine functionality and user experience, followed\
    \ by a deployment phase to a reliable cloud hosting service, ensuring scalability and security. Continuous maintenance\
    \ will be paramount to adapt to user feedback, update content, and implement necessary security measures, thereby ensuring\
    \ the website remains a premier destination for astrology aficionados.\n```\nassistant: Will the live event participation\
    \ feature require a video streaming capability?\nuser: Yes\nassistant: Will the storefront for astrology books need to\
    \ support digital products, physical products, or both?\nuser: Digital Products to start.\nassistant: Should the mastery\
    \ courses have any form of user progress tracking or assessments, such as quizzes or certifications?\nuser: Yes\nassistant:\
    \ Are there any specific astrological computation functionalities that you need beyond general zodiac information?\nuser:\
    \ Natal Chart Calculations: To generate a user\u2019s natal chart, precise calculations based on their exact time, date,\
    \ and place of birth are required to determine the positions of the planets and other celestial bodies at that moment.\n\
    Transit Forecasts: These involve calculating the ongoing movement of planets and interpreting their influence on a user's\
    \ natal chart over time, which can be used for personal horoscopes and predictive astrology.\nSynastry and Compatibility\
    \ Reports: These compare the natal charts of two individuals to analyze relationship dynamics and compatibility.\nProgression\
    \ Charts: This advanced technique progresses the natal chart forward to reflect personal development and life changes.\n\
    Electional Astrology: Choosing the most astrologically auspicious times for events like weddings or business launches.\n\
    Horary Astrology: Answering specific questions by analyzing the chart of the moment a question is understood by the astrologer.\n\
    Astrological Matching for Events: A feature for matching users with upcoming astrology events based on their natal charts\
    \ or current transits.\nassistant: Will the blog feature require a content management system that allows for creating,\
    \ editing, and organizing posts by multiple authors?\nuser: No, only a single admin author, specifically the Astrologer\
    \ who owns the website. ```"
response: The project, "starfires_v2," is an Astrology website offering live event participation with video streaming, a digital
  storefront for astrology books, an informative single-admin blog, and mastery courses featuring user progress tracking and
  assessments. The development stack includes React, Node.js, Express, Python for astrological computations, Socket.IO for
  real-time communication, MongoDB, and authentication with OAuth or JWT. The site will provide features like natal chart
  calculations, transit forecasts, synastry and compatibility reports, progression charts, electional astrology, horary astrology,
  and event matching based on astrological data. The process encompasses UI/UX design, functionality and user experience testing,
  deployment to a cloud hosting service, and ongoing maintenance for content updates and security.
