  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"starfires_v2\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"starfires_v2\":\n```\nThe project, \"starfires_v2,\" is an Astrology website offering\
    \ live event participation with video streaming, a digital storefront for astrology books, an informative single-admin\
    \ blog, and mastery courses featuring user progress tracking and assessments. The development stack includes React, Node.js,\
    \ Express, Python for astrological computations, Socket.IO for real-time communication, MongoDB, and authentication with\
    \ OAuth or JWT. The site will provide features like natal chart calculations, transit forecasts, synastry and compatibility\
    \ reports, progression charts, electional astrology, horary astrology, and event matching based on astrological data.\
    \ The process encompasses UI/UX design, functionality and user experience testing, deployment to a cloud hosting service,\
    \ and ongoing maintenance for content updates and security.\n```\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for\
    \ this project:\n```\n- React\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- Python\n- Swagger\n- Socket.IO\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n- OAuth\n\
    - JWT\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- D3.js\n- axios\n- cronjob\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into\
    \ smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the Node.js backend, setup Express server with basic\
    \ routing, and install core dependencies.\n\n2. Configure MongoDB database connection using Mongoose and create a User\
    \ schema to handle user data.\n\n3. Implement authentication system using OAuth and JWT with routes for registration,\
    \ login, and user session management.\n\n4. Build the React frontend setup along with the initial UI components using\
    \ Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3.\n\n5. Integrate Socket.IO for real-time communication and setup mechanisms to handle live\
    \ video streaming on the platform.\n\n6. Design and implement the digital storefront including the schema for store products\
    \ and the shopping cart functionality.\n\n7. Create the blog infrastructure with single-admin CRUD operations and draft\
    \ blogging interface.\n\n8. Develop mastery courses area with user progress tracking, assessments and Python backend computation\
    \ for astrology charts.\n\n9. Implement natal chart calculations, transit forecasts, compatibility reports, and other\
    \ astrological services.\n\n10. Setup D3.js integration for data visualization and implement dynamic charts representing\
    \ astrological data.\n\n11. Refine UI/UX and ensure responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and implement graceful\
    \ error handling.\n\n12. Create a cron job for routine database backup and maintenance.\n\n13. Conduct final integration\
    \ testing to ensure all components of the website operate cohesively.\n\n```\nYou are currently working on task \"Configure\
    \ MongoDB database connection using Mongoose and create a User schema to handle user data.\" and you have to focus only\
    \ on that task.\n\n\nA part of the app is already finished.Here are files that are currently implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n\

    \ some additional info. Here it is:\n```\nThere is no starfires_v2 database.\n```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement\
    \ changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to be written or modified to\
    \ implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages\
    \ listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\
    \n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as\
    \ possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than\
    \ 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    Do not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed."

  content: "Based on the information provided and the task assigned, it seems we need to ascertain that a connection to the\
    \ MongoDB database is successfully established and that the database \"starfires_v2\" is created when a connection is\
    \ initiated. The code provided for `config/db.js` appears to be set up correctly to connect to a MongoDB instance. However,\
    \ MongoDB will not create the database until data is actually written to it.\n\nTo ensure that the User schema is properly\
    \ initialized and that a connection to the database is being made (creating the database in this process if it does not\
    \ exist), you need to ensure that the User schema is being used somewhere in your application.\n\nSince the User model\
    \ is already defined in `models/User.js`, you could create a simple route in your Express application that inserts a new\
    \ User document into the MongoDB database. This action will trigger the creation of the \"starfires_v2\" database in MongoDB\
    \ if it does not already exist.\n\nBelow I will demonstrate how you might add a route in your server to create a test\
    \ user, which will ensure that your database is being used, and thus created at the first write operation. We'll be doing\
    \ a minimal change in `server.js`.\n\n**/server.js**\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\
    \ // You need a middleware to handle JSON body requests\nconst connectDB = require('./config/db');\nconst User = require('./models/User');\
    \ // You need to require the User model\n\n// Connect Database\nconnectDB();\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Middleware\n\
    app.use(bodyParser.json()); // This lets us receive JSON payloads in POST requests\n\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT ||\
    \ 3001;\n\n// Test Route: Adds a test user to the database\napp.post('/api/test-user', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n\
    \    const newUser = new User(req.body);\n    await newUser.save();\n    res.status(201).json(newUser);\n  } catch(err)\
    \ {\n    res.status(500).json({errors: err.message});\n  }\n});\n\napp.get('/api/ping', (req, res) => {\n    res.json({\
    \ message: 'pong' });\n});\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\
    In the example above, we added a new POST route `/api/test-user`, which can be used to create a new user in the database.\
    \ The route receives a JSON object with `username`, `email`, and `password`, constructs a new `User` object from it, and\
    \ then saves it to the database. Since the `User` schema is tied to MongoDB through mongoose, the act of saving the user\
    \ should create the \"starfires_v2\" database if it does not already exist. \n\nMake sure to handle the situation where\
    \ a test user might already exist, or provide a way to delete it between tests.\n\nYou do not need to install any additional\
    \ dependencies since `body-parser` functionality is already included with express 4.16+ via `express.json()`. I've included\
    \ it as a habit of clarity and to ensure it works even if you are on an older version of express.\n\nOnce you have this\
    \ test route, you can use a tool like Postman or curl to send a POST request with a JSON payload to test creating a user.\
    \ If the database did not exist before, this action would create the \"starfires_v2\" database, and you would know the\
    \ MongoDB connection is configured properly.\n\nRemember to eventually remove this test route once the database connection\
    \ is verified and before moving to production to avoid potential security issues."
