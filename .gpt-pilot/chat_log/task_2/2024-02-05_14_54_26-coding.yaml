  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"starfires_v2\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    starfires_v2\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"starfires_v2\":\n```\nThe project, \"starfires_v2,\"\
    \ is an Astrology website offering live event participation with video streaming, a digital storefront for astrology books,\
    \ an informative single-admin blog, and mastery courses featuring user progress tracking and assessments. The development\
    \ stack includes React, Node.js, Express, Python for astrological computations, Socket.IO for real-time communication,\
    \ MongoDB, and authentication with OAuth or JWT. The site will provide features like natal chart calculations, transit\
    \ forecasts, synastry and compatibility reports, progression charts, electional astrology, horary astrology, and event\
    \ matching based on astrological data. The process encompasses UI/UX design, functionality and user experience testing,\
    \ deployment to a cloud hosting service, and ongoing maintenance for content updates and security.\n```\n\n\nHere are\
    \ the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- React\n\n- Node.js\n\n- Express\n\n- Python\n\n- Swagger\n\
    \n- Socket.IO\n\n- MongoDB\n\n- Mongoose\n\n- OAuth\n\n- JWT\n\n- Bootstrap\n\n- HTML\n\n- CSS3\n\n- D3.js\n\n- axios\n\
    \n- cronjob\n\n```\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this code has been implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"starfires_v2\"\
    ,\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"server.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"\
    nodemon\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\"\

    \ running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1.\
    \ Initialize the Node.js backend, setup Express server with basic routing, and install core dependencies.\n\n2. Configure\
    \ MongoDB database connection using Mongoose and create a User schema to handle user data.\n\n3. Implement authentication\
    \ system using OAuth and JWT with routes for registration, login, and user session management.\n\n4. Build the React frontend\
    \ setup along with the initial UI components using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3.\n\n5. Integrate Socket.IO for real-time\
    \ communication and setup mechanisms to handle live video streaming on the platform.\n\n6. Design and implement the digital\
    \ storefront including the schema for store products and the shopping cart functionality.\n\n7. Create the blog infrastructure\
    \ with single-admin CRUD operations and draft blogging interface.\n\n8. Develop mastery courses area with user progress\
    \ tracking, assessments and Python backend computation for astrology charts.\n\n9. Implement natal chart calculations,\
    \ transit forecasts, compatibility reports, and other astrological services.\n\n10. Setup D3.js integration for data visualization\
    \ and implement dynamic charts representing astrological data.\n\n11. Refine UI/UX and ensure responsive design, cross-browser\
    \ compatibility, and implement graceful error handling.\n\n12. Create a cron job for routine database backup and maintenance.\n\
    \n13. Conduct final integration testing to ensure all components of the website operate cohesively.\n\n```\n\nYou are\
    \ currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n```\nConfigure MongoDB database connection using Mongoose\
    \ and create a User schema to handle user data.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\n\
    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Developer can demonstrate the\
    \ ability to perform CRUD operations on User documents in the MongoDB database through Mongoose.`\n\nNow, tell me all\
    \ the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to\
    \ be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always\
    \ try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file\
    \ becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an\
    \ empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do not need to\
    \ make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically\
    \ - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's\
    \ reserved."

  content: "To implement task #2, you will need to set up and configure the MongoDB database connection using Mongoose, and\
    \ define a User schema that can handle user data with capabilities to facilitate CRUD operations. You'll be installing\
    \ additional packages, setting up configuration files and creating models for your MongoDB collections.\n\nHere is what\
    \ you need to do:\n\n1. Install the necessary packages:\n```sh\nnpm install mongoose dotenv\n```\nThe `mongoose` package\
    \ will be used to interact with MongoDB in an object-oriented manner, while `dotenv` will allow you to manage environment\
    \ variables for database connection strings.\n\n2. Create environment variables for database connection:\n**/.env**\n\
    ```\nMONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/starfires_v2\n```\nMake sure MongoDB is running on `localhost:27017` or change\
    \ this accordingly to your MongoDB configuration.\n\n3. Setup the MongoDB connection using Mongoose:\n**/config/db.js**\n\
    ```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv');\n\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst connectDB\
    \ = async () => {\n  try {\n    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {\n      useNewUrlParser: true,\n      useUnifiedTopology:\
    \ true,\n      useCreateIndex: true,\n      useFindAndModify: false,\n    });\n    console.log('MongoDB Connected...');\n\
    \  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.message);\n    // Exit process with failure\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n};\n\
    \nmodule.exports = connectDB;\n```\nEnsure that the MongoDB server is running on your system or the `MONGO_URI` matches\
    \ the configuration of your MongoDB instance.\n\n4. Include the database connection in your main server file.\n**/server.js**\n\
    ```javascript\n// Other requires...\nconst connectDB = require('./config/db');\n\n// Connect Database\nconnectDB();\n\n\
    // Previous app setup...\n```\n\n5. Define a Mongoose schema for your User.\n**/models/User.js**\n```javascript\nconst\
    \ mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required:\
    \ true,\n    unique: true\n  },\n  email: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true\n  },\n  password:\
    \ {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  created_at: {\n    type: Date,\n    default: Date.now\n  },\n  last_login:\
    \ {\n    type: Date\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);\n```\nThis schema defines a user\
    \ with `username`, `email`, `password`, `created_at`, and `last_login` fields. Notice that fields `username` and `email`\
    \ are set to be unique, which helps avoid duplicate entries for these fields.\n\n6. (Optional) Integrate the connection\
    \ setup and user model into your existing server startup flow to verify that everything is working correctly.\n\n7. For\
    \ demonstration purposes, you could create sample routes to perform CRUD operations, but as you mentioned, you don't need\
    \ to create any automated test work. Nonetheless, this would be the starting point to test your setup using tools like\
    \ Postman or Swagger documentation.\n\nIf you follow these steps correctly, you will be able to perform CRUD operations\
    \ on User documents in the MongoDB database through Mongoose, fulfilling the programmatic goal set by your tech lead.\
    \ When the developer reviews the implementation, as long as they are able to use the model to create, read, update, and\
    \ delete user documents in the database, the user-review goal should also be met."

  content: 'How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully? If you specify a command that needs to be run
    or give example, be very specific. You don''t want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just
    follow your instructions. Note that any commands will be run on a Darwin machine.


    **IMPORTANT**

    In case the task can be tested by making an API request, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather
    write a full cURL command that the user can just run.

    **IMPORTANT**

    Do not require any code writing form the user for testing this task.


    Try your best to avoid this if possible, but if it is very difficult to test the task, you can just answer with only this
    sentence - `There is nothing specific to test for this task so you can write "continue" and we''ll move on to the next
    task.`'
response: "Since any testing would potentially require some kind of code for API endpoints to perform CRUD operations and\
  \ interact with the User model, we should aim to avoid requiring the user to write any code. However, given that writing\
  \ additional code is not an option as per your instructions, direct interaction with the database is difficult to accomplish\
  \ without temporary additional code or using third-party GUI tools like MongoDB Compass to visually confirm the schema and\
  \ perform operations.\n\nBut for the purpose of this task, to verify the User schema is created and working, one could use\
  \ a command-line MongoDB client to connect to the database and check if the \"users\" collection exists and the schema corresponds\
  \ to what was defined.\n\nHere are the specific instructions to test the task using the `mongo` command-line interface:\n\
  \n1. Open Terminal on your Darwin machine.\n\n2. Connect to the MongoDB database using the following command (replace with\
  \ the actual database connection parameters if they differ):\n```sh\nmongo mongodb://localhost:27017/starfires_v2\n```\n\
  \n3. Once connected to the MongoDB instance, run the following commands in the MongoDB shell to verify the existence of\
  \ the User collection and to inspect its structure:\n```javascript\nuse starfires_v2;  // Switch to the appropriate database\
  \ if not already in it.\nshow collections;  // This should list 'users' among the collections.\ndb.users.find({}); // This\
  \ won't output anything or might output documents if any users have been added.\n```\n\nLooking at these outputs, the user\
  \ can confirm whether the user schema has been created and if basic interaction with the MongoDB database is possible. However,\
  \ without a proper API in place, further CRUD operation testing through an HTTP interface requires the relevant code.\n\n\
  Alternatively, if the above direct MongoDB interaction is not desirable, you can choose to move on to the next task with\
  \ the understanding that the code required for testing will be written in the future when developing API endpoints.\n \n\
  So given the constraints, you might want to respond \"continue\" to move on to the next task without interactive testing\
  \ at this stage."
