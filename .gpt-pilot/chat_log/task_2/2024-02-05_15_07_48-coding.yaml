  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"starfires_v2\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"starfires_v2\":\n```\nThe project, \"starfires_v2,\" is an Astrology website offering\
    \ live event participation with video streaming, a digital storefront for astrology books, an informative single-admin\
    \ blog, and mastery courses featuring user progress tracking and assessments. The development stack includes React, Node.js,\
    \ Express, Python for astrological computations, Socket.IO for real-time communication, MongoDB, and authentication with\
    \ OAuth or JWT. The site will provide features like natal chart calculations, transit forecasts, synastry and compatibility\
    \ reports, progression charts, electional astrology, horary astrology, and event matching based on astrological data.\
    \ The process encompasses UI/UX design, functionality and user experience testing, deployment to a cloud hosting service,\
    \ and ongoing maintenance for content updates and security.\n```\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for\
    \ this project:\n```\n- React\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- Python\n- Swagger\n- Socket.IO\n- MongoDB\n- Mongoose\n- OAuth\n\
    - JWT\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- D3.js\n- axios\n- cronjob\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into\
    \ smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize the Node.js backend, setup Express server with basic\
    \ routing, and install core dependencies.\n\n2. Configure MongoDB database connection using Mongoose and create a User\
    \ schema to handle user data.\n\n3. Implement authentication system using OAuth and JWT with routes for registration,\
    \ login, and user session management.\n\n4. Build the React frontend setup along with the initial UI components using\
    \ Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3.\n\n5. Integrate Socket.IO for real-time communication and setup mechanisms to handle live\
    \ video streaming on the platform.\n\n6. Design and implement the digital storefront including the schema for store products\
    \ and the shopping cart functionality.\n\n7. Create the blog infrastructure with single-admin CRUD operations and draft\
    \ blogging interface.\n\n8. Develop mastery courses area with user progress tracking, assessments and Python backend computation\
    \ for astrology charts.\n\n9. Implement natal chart calculations, transit forecasts, compatibility reports, and other\
    \ astrological services.\n\n10. Setup D3.js integration for data visualization and implement dynamic charts representing\
    \ astrological data.\n\n11. Refine UI/UX and ensure responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and implement graceful\
    \ error handling.\n\n12. Create a cron job for routine database backup and maintenance.\n\n13. Conduct final integration\
    \ testing to ensure all components of the website operate cohesively.\n\n```\nYou are currently working on task \"Configure\
    \ MongoDB database connection using Mongoose and create a User schema to handle user data.\" and you have to focus only\
    \ on that task.\n\n\nA part of the app is already finished.Here are files that are currently implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n\

    Now, your colleague who is testing the app \"starfires_v2\" sent you some additional info. Here it is:\n```\n\n> starfires_v2@1.0.0\
    \ start\n> nodemon\n\n\e[33m[nodemon] 2.0.22\e[39m\n\e[33m[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`\e[39m\n\e[33m[nodemon]\

    \ ./server.js`\e[39m\nServer running on port 3001\noptions usecreateindex, usefindandmodify are not supported\n\e[31m[nodemon]\
    \ app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...\e[39m\n\n```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement changes\
    \ to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to be written or modified to implement\
    \ current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed\
    \ in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible\
    \ and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines\
    \ of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not\
    \ tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed."

  content: "The log suggests that the application crashed due to the deprecated `useCreateIndex` and `useFindAndModify` options\
    \ within the Mongoose connect configuration. \n\nTo resolve this issue, make the following changes:\n\n**config/db.js**\n\
    \n```\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv');\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst connectDB =\
    \ async () => {\n  try {\n    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {\n      useNewUrlParser: true,\n      useUnifiedTopology:\
    \ true\n      // Removed the useCreateIndex and useFindAndModify as they are not supported in newer Mongoose versions.\n\
    \    });\n    console.log('MongoDB Connected...');\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.message);\n    // Exit process\
    \ with failure\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = connectDB;\n```\n\nWith these changes, the options that\
    \ were causing the crash have been removed. Remember that newer versions of Mongoose no longer require these options as\
    \ they have become the default behavior.\n\nNow that the immediate crash issue is resolved, let's ensure that the User\
    \ schema and database connection are set up correctly:\n\nMake sure that the `/models/User.js` file is correctly structured:\n\
    \n**models/User.js**\n\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n\
    \  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true\n  },\n  email: {\n    type: String,\n    required:\
    \ true,\n    unique: true\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  created_at: {\n    type:\
    \ Date,\n    default: Date.now\n  },\n  last_login: {\n    type: Date\n  }\n  // Other relevant user properties can be\
    \ added here.\n});\n\nmodule.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);\n```\n\nBy manually reviewing this schema,\
    \ we ensure it contains the fields needed for the User entity within \"starfires_v2\". \n\nOnce you have made these changes,\
    \ restart the app with:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nIf the database connection is successful and there are no other errors\
    \ in the console, then this task is considered programmatically complete according to the description.\n\nAs for the user-review\
    \ goal, you would need to verify that the User model conforms to the business requirements of the application, make sure\
    \ there are no errors regarding the database connection during routine app operations, and ensure that user validation\
    \ and access patterns are working as intended when used within registration or login processes (to be implemented in the\
    \ future tasks).\n\nSince there are no new dependencies introduced beyond what is already in the `package.json`, no new\
    \ installation commands are required at this point."
